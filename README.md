## GASH Scav Hunt 2021

That Kid Discord bot for Item 193:

"Remember That Kid from your SOSC class who wouldn’t do the reading, but would still interrupt the professor to start their own lecture on Hegel? If only we could get their thoughts on other topics. Well with your new That Kid chatbot, we can simply type in any word and receive a long winded lecture full of unnecessary references to famous philosophers. Make a functioning That Kid chatbot and send us a list of recommended things that we should ask it about. But like any That Kid, it should be prepared to offer us a strong opinion on any subject, even if it hasn’t done the reading."
